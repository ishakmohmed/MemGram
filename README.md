MemGram is a project that I was super excited to build because I had just learned Redux a couple of days before creating this project and wanted to build something with it.
It is a social media web app where you can post your memories with pics. You can like posts, edit, or delete them.

[3] Name of Web Application: MemGram

[4] Intro: MemGram is a full stack social media web application made using the famous MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Using this application, you can share your memories with picture and other details. It has got a super sleek UI thanks to Material-UI design library by Google. The images are stored in MongoDB with Base64 URL (basically in complex strings), and then displayed in the Post.jsx component. Click the heart icon to like a post and delete icon to delete a post. When you click the more icon (three horizontal dots) at top right of each post, the form will be populated with that post's data. Then you simple need to edit any field you want and post the updated form and the changes will be visible immediately. Add a new post by filling up the form (don't forget to select an image to your post).
